# Subnetwork

I have many computers on subnetworks, that's why I need to create a reverse proxy to communicate with them.

- [ ] Reverse proxy communication

What we are going to do is that the main server of a subnetwork will track other servers in its own network, then an external server will be able to communicate with them by providing an identification.

Use a field like server_node id
