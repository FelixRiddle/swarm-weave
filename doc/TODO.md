# Priority TODO

# Version 1.0.0

This will be the main functionality, features should be considered optional.

The main functionality is to connect to a server.

- [ ] Connect to server
    - [ ] Fetch server information

## Features

From now on these features will be next releases

## Version 2.0.0

This works good enough, but libp2p will likely have lots of optimizations.

- [ ] Subnetworks devices discovery(Without using libp2p)
    - [ ] Create a reverse proxy server
    - [ ] Scan the network for devices
    - [ ] Store in the database and replicate devices information on the network
    - [ ] Use a hashmap to store devices information
    - [ ] (Optional) A cool feature now is to assign a UUID to each device and identificate them with that

## Version 3.0.0

- [ ] Discover all devices on the network and subnetworks

Too hard using libp2p
